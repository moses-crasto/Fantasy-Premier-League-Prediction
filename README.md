# Fantasy-Premier-League-Prediction

This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict player points in Fantasy Premier League (FPL) for each gameweek. We applied various feature engineering techniques and data pre-processing steps to build predictive models. The performance of multiple algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, was compared.

The proposed models achieved a **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** of approximately **1.97** and a **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** of around **1.03**, outperforming several existing approaches in the literature. These results indicate that machine learning has significant potential for improving decision-making in FPL strategies.
